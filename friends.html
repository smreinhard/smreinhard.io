I have been in college for two years, so I have valuable lessons to share on how to make friends. Below is a list of common places to make friends in college, some stories of how I made friends in college, and pictures of me and the friends I made!</p>

<p>Here are the stories of how I met my best three friends at college.:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>Meeting Angela</strong></dt>
    <dd>Angela was a classmate of mine in my CHEM 109 discussion during my first semester of college. I became friends with Angela by going up to her at our first discussion session and saying "You look cool. We should be friends".</dd>

    <dt><strong>Meeting Julia</strong></dt>
    <dd>I met Julia because she lived in a dorm building right next to mine. I had heard of her through a mutual friend, and one day I decided to invite her to my dorm room to hang out. We have been friends since!</dd>

    <dt><strong>Meeting Sasha</strong></dt>
    <dd>I met Sasha because she was a friend of Julia's from high school. Once you make one good friend, you are bound to meet some of their friends and like them too!</dd>
