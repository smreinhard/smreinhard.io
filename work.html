<h2 style="font-size:30px;">This section is about how to balance college with work.</h2>

<p>College is <u>expensive</u>. Most students need to work a job or multiple jobs to help pay for tuition, rent, groceries, activities with friends, textbooks, etc. However, being a student and working a job can cause extreme stress. I have personally had many panic attacks and late nights due to this situation. Now I would like to share my tips with you to help balance the two.</p> 

<p>Here are three tips that have helped me balance work and school.</p>

</body>

<ol>
  <li>Know Your Limits</li>
  <li>Use Google Calendar</li>
  <li>Communicate with Your Professors and Supervisors</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is how to implement the above tips.:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>Know Your Limits</strong></dt>
    <dd>A lesson that was difficult for me to learn throughout this process is the ability to say "No."" to your friends, classmates, supervisors, and professors. Sometimes I had to tell my friends I was not going to go to a party because I needed to study for a test, and sometiems I had to tell my boss I would not pick up an extra shift because I was too stressed about my next exam. Knowing your limits helps maintain your inner peace.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Use Google Calendar</strong></dt>
    <dd>Use a Google Calendar or something similar to keep track of when your shifts, exams, and projects are. I also like to block out time to study and time to relax. This tactic ensures I do not overbook myself or forget anything.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Communicate with Your Professors and Supervisors</strong></dt>
    <dd>If you need an extension on a project or to switch shift times, professors and supervisors are usually understanding with ample communication and effort. They are people and have probably been a college student too. Make sure to be polite and thorough in your communication, and ask for extensions days or even weeks before it is needed.</dd>

<p>I like to do my homework at a cafe in between work and class to have a change of settings and to help with my inner peace.</p>
